    <h1 class=h1-tahoma><b>White chocolate, orange & cranberry Christmas cake</b></h1>

<p><p style="font-family:monospace,Trebuchet MS;font-size:15px">Christmas with a rich, 
    moist fruitcake, or perhaps a modern sponge-based creation. We've got 
    all the recipes you need and tips for decorating, too.</p>

    <h2><i>Method</i></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put the dried fruit, zests and juice, alcohol, butter and sugar in a large pan 
        set over a medium heat. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 
        5 mins. Tip the fruit mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool for 30 mins.</li>

    <li>Heat oven to 150C. Line a deep 20cm cake tin with a double layer 
        of baking parchment, then wrap a double layer of newspaper around the outside 
        â€“ tie with string to secure.</li>
        
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the fruit mixture and stir well, making sure 
        there are no pockets of flour. Tip into your prepared tin, level the top with 
        a spatula and bake in the centre of the oven for 2 hrs.</li></ol>
